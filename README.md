# phase-shift-optimization-rspace
Optimizing phase shifts for r-space or coordinate space. Currently working on N2LO for phase shifts.

## Goal as of 03/16/2020

The current goal is to automate Sanjoy's process for calculating phase shifts and low energy parameters.

Currently Sanjoy has to manually edit coefficients, recompile a fortran binary, and then run said fortran binary.
